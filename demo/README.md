# Demo Website

The demo website to show features of the measure library.
This site fires actual gtag and measure library events, and
displays the code for them.

# Deploying the app locally

To run the app locally, navigate to this /demo directory,
then type the following commands in the console.

```shell script
yarn build
yarn start
```

For a faster startup without building any files,
you can run the command

```shell script
yarn qstart
```

(You can replace yarn with npm in any of the above commands
if you would prefer.)

Then, navigate to localhost:3000 to run the app.
