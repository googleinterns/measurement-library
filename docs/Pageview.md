# Pageview
Almost any analytics software will have some way to measure page view events. This page
gives an example of how to send a pageview event. In this example, we will use the
google analytics processor.

First, configure the processor on your [page.](https://googleinterns.github.io/measurement-library/#/?id=installation)
Perhaps we want to specify the page title in all of our events, so we will set 

<!-- tabs:start -->
#### ** React **
Hello!

#### ** Angular **
Bonjour!

<!-- tabs:end -->
