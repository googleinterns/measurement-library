# Measurement Library

Measurement library will provide an open source alternative for sites/apps to send events to Google Analytics.

**This is not an officially supported Google product.**

# Overview
Measurement Library is a utility to help developers send data collected from their website to
other libraries for analytics. After specifying settings in a script tag, you can process any
sent events using a variety of built in event processors (e.g. sending data to Google Analytics).

Data from events or generated by event processors is automatically saved to persist between visits using your choice of
a variety of different storage options (e.g. cookies).

# Installation
First, install the package with your favorite package manager:
```bash
yarn add measurement-library
// or
npm install measurement-library
```

Next, choose [the event processor](#event-processors) and [the storage implementation](#storage-interfaces)
to use and include this code in your `<head>` tag. It should be placed as high up in the block as possible
in order to catch users who leave immediately after loading the page, then immediately leave.
```html
<!-- Measurement Library Snippet -->
<script async src="./node_modules/measurement-library/dist/measure"/>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function measure(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  // One or more config commands. To send data to google analytics while 
  // using cookies for storage:
  measure('config', 'googleAnalytics', {}, 'cookies', {});
</script>
```

[//]: # (TODO kj: Make the config command use the right settings for google analytics)

As an alternative, you can use the development version when testing your page. The dev version has a bigger file size,
but reports possible errors to the console.
```html
<!-- Measurement Library Snippet (Development Version) -->
<script async src="./node_modules/measurement-library/dist/measure-debug"/>
<script>/* Configure script like last example. */ </script>
```

# Usage
After setting up the script tags, you can begin to use the library. All commands
are processed by passing arguments to the  `measure()` function. 

## Event command
When you run the command `measure('event', eventName, eventOptions)`, all registered
[event processors](#event-processors) will read the event and perform actions corresponding
to their API.

## Set command
To save parameters beyond the current page, you can call the command `measure('set', key, value)`.
The registered event processor will determine if the value should be saved, how long the value should
be saved for, and save it. To overwrite this behavior, you can specify a third time-to-live parameter:
`measure('set', key, value, secondsToLive)`. In particular, if `secondsToLive` is 0, no data will be saved
to long term storage.

The set command can also be used to set parameters related to a implementation of
an event processor or storage interface. For example, to modify the default parameters
of the cookies storage, run a `set` command in the script tag before calling
`config`. 

```js
// Set the default cookie parameters
measure('set', 'cookies', {prefix: 'my_', expires: 11});
// Use the default cookie parameters: prefix 'my_' and expires 11.
measure('config', 'eventProcessorName', {}, 'cookies', {});
// Override a default cookie parameter: expires is 22 for this storage.
measure('config', 'eventProcessorName', {}, 'cookies', {expires: 22});
```

# Local Setup
## Creating The Build
You will need to have either [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable) installed.

First, install dependencies with yarn or npm
```shell script
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

Next, run the tests using yarn or npm:

```shell script
yarn test
# or
npm run test
```

## Running Tests Interactively
You can also run the tests "interactively" via Karma directly.

```shell script
yarn unit
# or
npm run unit
```

To run the integration tests instead of the unit tests,

```shell script
yarn integration
# or
npm run integration
```
